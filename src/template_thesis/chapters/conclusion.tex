Weiterentwicklungsm√∂glichkeiten

In this case the \gls{gl:ab} was implemented as a part of \gls{gl:monogui} and used for \gls{ac:m8} only. As discussed in chapter ~\ref{chap:adt} section \ref{sec:adt2} Having a central and unified home for log monitoring and further processing especially on an organisation level further improve and complies with \gls{gl:adt2} vision. querring raw events from \gls{ac:m8} or any event-sourced system is and should be possible. Depending on the use-case further processing upon ingestion might be needed to allow for some unification .....


Process mining poses a lot of possibilities and combained with \gls{gl:es} allow for very advanced log analisys and bhaviour control .........
