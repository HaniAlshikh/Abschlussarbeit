In this case the \gls{gl:ab} was implemented as a part of \gls{gl:monogui} and used for \gls{ac:m8} only. As discussed in chapter ~\ref{chap:adt} section \ref{sec:adt2} Having a central and unified home for log monitoring and further processing especially on an organisation level further improve and complies with \gls{gl:adt2} vision. querring raw events from \gls{ac:m8} or any event-sourced system is and should be possible. Depending on the use-case further processing upon ingestion might be needed to allow for some unification .....


Process mining poses a lot of possibilities and combained with \gls{gl:es} allow for very advanced log analisys and bhaviour control .........

In summary, event sourcing offers several advantages over traditional database systems when it comes to auditing. It provides a more detailed and transparent audit trail, allows for the reconstruction of the data's history from the event log, and allows for the implementation of fine-grained access controls. These advantages make event sourcing a valuable tool for organizations that need to ensure the integrity and transparency of their data.

In conclusion, event sourcing offers several advantages in terms of auditing and accountability compared to other architectures. Its detailed and comprehensive audit trail, ability to reconstruct past states, and robust and flexible approach make it a powerful tool for ensuring transparency and accountability in applications.

the studie contudcted by ..... on 25 engineers of different backgrounds and roles by applying appling Grounded Theory (GT). Adolph et al. (2011) which showcase how event sourcing is ganging on popularity especially when it comes to satisfying auditory needs. As put by one of the engineers when asked about event sourcing ""
The reasons for applying event sourcing can be grouped into four categories. Remarkably, all systems under study benefit from event sourcing, and no system returned to a current state model. Still, most engineers state that they would not apply event sourcing in every system. The reason given for this opinion is the added complexity of introducing event sourcing. Engineer E2 would apply event sourcing by default, because of the benefits it gives.~\citep{OVEREEM2021110970}
