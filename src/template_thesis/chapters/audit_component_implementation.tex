\chapter{\gls{gl:ac}}\label{chap:ac}

As discussed in chapter \ref{chap:sadt} choosing the correct architecture for auditing is an important choice to make. Handling auditing and audit logging as first class citizens comes with its owen constraints and requirements.

In an industry where strict auditing requirements apply using patterns like \gls{gl:es} not only ensures a complaint audit log but also lays the ground work for broader auditing technologies like \gls{gl:adt2}

Combining \gls{ac:ddd}, \gls{gl:es}, and \gls{ac:cqrs} produces an architecture that is praised by many, when it comes to building audit first cloud systems.

To showcase the capabilities of such architecture and evaluate the development overhead compared to the gained benefits a real word example was chosen as a base to implement the \gls{gl:ac} from scratch.

The \gls{gl:ac} utilises the produced event log by the \gls{gl:es} implementation to offer an auditing \gls{ac:api}, that can be utilised by all kind of clients like auditing programs as described in section \ref{sec:adt2sa} or in this case by the \gls{gl:ab} implemented in chapter \ref{chap:ab}

\section{Monoskope}\label{sec:m8}

Monoskope (short m8 spelled "mate") implements the management and operation of authenticating and authorizing entities in a \gls{gl:k8s} multi-cloud multi-cluster environments. It fulfills the needs of operators of the clusters as well as the needs of developers using the cloud infrastructure provided by the operators~\citep{monoskope}.

\subsection{Architecture}

\Gls{ac:m8} was designed with auditing in mind. It uses the event-sourced architecture [\ref{sec:esa}] with a purpose built implementation of the \gls{gl:est} as well as the \gls{ac:cqrs} pattern.

\includenamedimage[1]{figures/monoskope-architecture}{Monoskope Architecture ~\citep{monoskope}}
Since \gls{ac:m8} is meant to be used as the single source of truth authority for authenticating and authorizing users into different clusters on different cloud providers ensuring auditability and complying with different regulators requirements was not an option.

While the base system was implemented and the main features were complete \gls{ac:m8} still lacked a proper implementation to utilise the gained event log and offer an auditing \gls{ac:api}, that answers Auditors questions.

\Gls{ac:m8} has no classic \acrshort{ac:crud} database with tables for storing state, however, the transient state built based on that has. The following is the data model for the projected transient state:

\includenamedimage[1]{figures/monoskope_data_module}{Monoskope data module}

Generally users represent developers that are bound/a part of one or many teams/tenants that are bound/have access to one or many clusters.

\section{Requirements}

\Gls{ac:m8} has by nature a full audit log of every change to the system. This should be utilised to provide auditors and operators the ability to get detailed information of who is allowed to do what and why to answer questions like:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How did a user get a specific role?
  \item How did a user become a tenant member?
  \item What actions were taken by a user?
  \item etc\dots
\end{itemize}

Auditors have different backgrounds and technical knowledge thus all events musst have a human-readable representation.

It should be possible to utilise \gls{gl:es}'s temporal quires [\ref{sec:escp}] to get a users overview at any date and time 

\subsection{Use-Cases}

From the requirements overview the following use-cases were derived:
