\chapter{Introduction}

Audits are systematic and objective examinations of one or more aspects of an organization, that compares what the organization does to a defined set of criteria or requirements. \gls{ac:it} auditing examines processes, \gls{ac:it} assets, and controls at multiple levels within an organization to determine the extent to which the organization adheres to applicable standards or requirements. 

\gls{gl:es} is a software architecture pattern that insures a complete log of changes made to a system as a series of events. Instead of storing the current state in a traditional database, \gls{gl:es} stores the history of changes made over time. This allows developers to rebuild the current state at any point in time and see exactly how it changed by replaying the stored events, which is very useful for debugging and performing rollbacks or reversals of changes.

Having a comprehensive and immutable audit trail makes \gls{gl:es} particularly well-suited for systems with complex business processes, that need to track and audit changes to sensitive data and ensure they are in compliance with regulations and standards without relying on traditional logging mechanisms.

In addition to providing a detailed audit trail, \gls{gl:es} also offers a number of other benefits. Since the events are stored in a chronological order, it is possible to implement time-based queries and manipulations, which lays the base for \gls{gl:adt2} [\ref{sec:adt2}].

Besides evaluating \gls{gl:es} in regards to auditing and audit logging 
this work handles a real world use-case of auditors needs to track users authentication and authorization activities in \gls{ac:k8s} (a system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications).

Not only dose this apply to different environments users activities may span multiple \gls{ac:k8s} instances, also known as clusters, that are hosted by multiple hosting providers (Clouds).

The event-sourced authentication and authorization management system in use by a \gls{gl:fintech} organization will be extended by implementing an \gls{gl:ac} to serialize the event log into human-readable audit log and offer an audit \gls{ac:api}, that can be utilised by various clients.

Since auditors tend to have all kind of technical backgrounds an \gls{gl:ab} is also implemented, which should ease auditors interactions with the system and help answer various compliance questions with minimal overhead.
